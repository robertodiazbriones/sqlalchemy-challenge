# sqlalchemy-challenge

SQLAlchemy homework corresponds to the 10th unit of the **Data Analisis bootcamp course**, the first part of this assignment we were assign to do queries to SQLite database, this databse correspond to the data of the climate stations in Hawaii :sunny::palm_tree::ocean: on the second part we have to design a Flask App to return some information from the same database :robot::computer:. 

## What I learnt

With this unit we finished the first half of the course, as we advance we can see/practice how all what we have learnt is used and work together to a real day to date porpuse, as in the SQL homework assembly building queries is the backbone of getting the correct data and find what we are looking for.
